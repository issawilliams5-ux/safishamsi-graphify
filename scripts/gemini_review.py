"""Second opinion pass: send a YouTube tutorial to Gemini and get a build spec back.

Gemini reads the video natively, its own frames plus the audio, instead of reading
frames someone else picked. That makes it an independent witness to the same
tutorial your coding agent just watched.

  gemini_review.py <youtube-url-or-file> [--focus "the part I care about"]
                   [--samples 2] [--fps 1] [--start 0] [--end 600] [--key KEY]

PROMPT = """You are writing a build spec for a coding agent that will reproduce what this tutorial teaches. The agent cannot watch video. Your text is the only thing it will have.

Focus: {focus}

Report exactly this, in this order:

1. WHAT IS BEING BUILT. One paragraph. The actual outcome, not the pitch.

2. STACK AND PREREQUISITES. Every tool, package, model, service and account that appears on screen or is named out loud. Give exact names and versions when they are visible. Mark anything that costs money.

3. COMMANDS AND CONFIG, VERBATIM. Every command typed into a terminal, every file path, every env var, every config value you can actually read on screen. Quote it exactly. If a value is blurred, truncated or scrolled past, write UNREADABLE rather than guessing it.

4. THE BUILD ORDER. The steps in the order they were performed, including any step that was undone or redone. Say plainly where the video skips ahead or cuts to a finished state.

5. GOTCHAS. Every error hit on screen, every warning given out loud, every "make sure you" aside. These are the highest value part of the spec.

6. WHAT THE VIDEO DOES NOT SHOW. The gaps a builder would fall into: setup done off camera, values pasted from somewhere unexplained, steps asserted but never demonstrated.

Rules:
- Describe only what is in THIS video. If something you would expect from a tutorial of this kind is absent, say it is absent. Do not fill it in from general knowledge.
- Prefer the exact string on screen over a paraphrase of it.
- Timestamps are your weakest output. Give them as rough markers only and never as a measurement."""
